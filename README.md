# Machine-Learning
The Repository is about typical Machine-Learning (ML) algorithms.

## Types of Machine Learning Algorithms:
- **Supervised Learning**
  - Classification
    - Random Forest
    - Decision Trees
    - Support Vector Machine
  - Regression
    - Linear Regression
    - Regression Trees
    - Non-Linear Regression
- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - Clustering
    - K-means Clustering
    - K-nearest neighbors
- Reinforcement Learning

## Aplication in Machine Learning
